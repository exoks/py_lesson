3|> Time Series Forcasting Models

# QUESTION:[ ESTIMATION VS PREDICTION VS FORECASTING ]==========================
# - ESTIMATION: Focues on 'current or past values' not future onces. 
# - PREDICTION: can be future or unseen inputs, but does not necessarily account
#               for time order.
# - FORCASTING: Always 'time-dependent', often handles trends, seasonality and
#   cycles.
# _____________________________________________________________________________
# | Concept     | Time-     | Focus               | Example                   |
# |             |dependent? |                     |                           |
# |-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
# | Estimation  | No        | Current/past values | Average sales last month  |
# | Prediction  | Maybe     | Specific outcome    | Will it rain tomorrow?    |
# | Forecasting | Yes       | Future over time    | Next month‚Äôs bakery sales |
# |_____________|___________|_____________________|___________________________|
# - Forcasting = making predictions about 'future or unknown values' based on
#   'patterns in past or known data'.
# NOTE:[ IMPORTANT NOTES ]------------------------------------------------------
# - The data does not have to be tied to time
# - Time Series Forcasting (Special Case)
# - When data is not tied to time, forecasting looks very similar to
#   'regression' or 'predictions tasks' in ML. 
#   . Forecasting 'house prices' based on features (size, location, rooms)
#   . Forecasting 'product dement' from product attributes, not necessarily from 
#     time.
# - All time series forcasting is 'forcasting', But not all forcasting are time 
#   series.
# - [ Time series analysis = statistical field (older than ML) ]
# - [ Time series forecasting = can use ML methods             ]
# CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Forcasting: "What will happen in the future?"
# - Predection: "What is the target value given these inputs?" 
# - Estimation: "What are the hidden parameters that explain my data?" 

===[ Forcasting: ]==============================================================
* 'Forcasting' means 'making an informed prediction' about the future based on
  'past and present' data
  - Forecasting works because:
    . 'History influence the future'.
    . Data often follows 'patterns' (daily, weekly, seasonal, economic cycles) 

  # NOTE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - Forecasting is perhaps the most common application of machine learning
  #   in the real world.

  # INFO:-------------------------------------------------------------
  # - forcasting (noun): the job or activity of judging what is likely
  #   to happen in the future, based on the information you have now:

# CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Once data is related to 'time', the concept changes because observations are
#   no longer "independent": they become 'sequentially dependent', so you need
#   'time series forcasting' instead of regular prediction.
# - Forcasting = using past + present information to make predictions about the 
#   future, usually in situations where time plays a role.
# - In short Forcasting is a type of predection 'specifically for future values
#   over time' using historical data patterns.

  > [ Simple Example: ]
    * Imagine you run a small bakery:
      - You sold 50 bread of bread on Monday
      - 55 on Tuesday 
      - 53 on Wednesday
      - 60 on Thursday.

  - If you want to know 'how many bread to bake on Friday', you don't just guess
    randomly, you look at the 'past sales trend' ->> around 50-60 per day
  |-> That "educated guess" for Friday's sales is a "forecast".

===[ Forcasting Time Series Models ]============================================
* 'Time Series Analysis' Concept is a concept that data scientist tackle in
  their job
  - These are different approach to make prediction in case of time series

# QUESTION:[ time series are always related the concept of forcasting, Why? ]===
# * A 'time series' is simply a "sequence of data points collected over time 
#   usually at equal intervals".
#   - Examples
#     . Daily freight volumen at a port
#     . Montly sales
#     . Hourly electricity demand 
#     . Yearly population counts
#   formaly it is:
#     [ X = {x1, x2, x4, ..., xt} ]
#     where `xt` is the value observed at time t
# * Forcasting is the 'process' of using historical data to predict future
#   values 
#   > If the data is a 'time series' type, then we call it
#     |==> time series forcasting <===|
#   # NOTE:>--------------------------------------------------------------------
#   # - for casting can also apply to 'non-time' data
# CONCLUSION:[ Relationship between 'time series' and 'forcasting' ]============
# - Time Series -> the type of data (ordered in time)   | data structure
# - Forcasting  -> the task (predecting future values)  | the predection task
# - Time Series Forcasting -> A specific type of forcasting where the input data 
#   is 'time-dependent (time series)'
# - in simple word Predection of future points (values) in a time-ordered
#   dataset (time series) 
# REVISION:> Forcasting is predection technique as 'Estimation' and 'Prediction'

  # INFO:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - Uni-variate model means that the model deals with single time series 
  #   variable. 
  # - Multi-Variate model can handle multi-time series variable.
  # - Uni/Multi-variate model use depends on number of values we are predecting. 

  # NOTE:[ VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ]------------------------------------------ 
  # - All This model and approach that we have mentiend so far are treated
  #   as time series problem. this one can be converted as traditional  
  #   machine learning regression model.

===[ ARIMA Model ]===
* 'ARIMA' stands for 'Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average' it is a
  forcasting technique used to predict future data based on past data, especially 
  for things that change over time (like sales)
  - The model contains three parts:
    1|> `AR` (AutoRegressive) 
    2|> `I`  (Integrated) 
    3|> `MA` (Moving Average)
  - In simple ARIMA combines patterns (AR), trends(I), and corrections for
    surprises (MA) to make your `X` predictions as accurate as possible.

===[ SARIMA Model ]===
* 'SARIMA' stands  for 'Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average' is
  extension of ARIMA that adds the ability to handle 'seasonality' (recurring
  patterns like weekly, monthly, yearly cycles).
  - Good choise when:
    . Your data show 'trend' (increasing/decreasing pattern)
    . Your data shows 'seasonality (repeated cycles): daily, weekly, yearly' 
    # NOTE:[ THE Last ONE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ]==================
    . You want an interpretable, classical model before moving to complex ML/DL 
      models

    - Advantages of SARIMA:
      . Handles 'trend + seasonality' explicitly.
      . Works well for 'small to medium datasets'. 
      . Provides 'statistical interpretability' (you can explain coefficients) 
      . Often a 'Strong baseline' before trying ML/DL models
