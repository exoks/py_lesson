but why they have to use Figure , they can use Gride Layout that takes Axes directly ?

ChatGPT said:

You're asking an excellent architectural question — this goes to the heart of how Matplotlib's object model is designed.
❓ Why do we have to create a Figure and then assign Axes to it using a GridSpec?

Why can’t we just:

    “Let GridSpec manage Axes directly without going through Figure?”

🧱 Short Answer:

    Because the Figure is the master container — everything must live inside it: axes, titles, layout, legends, and even the canvas itself.

🧠 GridSpec is only a layout helper.

It’s not a container. It doesn’t draw anything.
It just tells the Figure:

    “Here’s how to divide yourself into a grid.”

⚙️ Longer Answer: The Design Philosophy

| Component  | Role                                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Figure`   | The full canvas that is eventually saved/shown. Contains everything.          |
| `Axes`     | The actual plotting area (like a subplot). Draws data (lines, scatter, etc.). |
| `GridSpec` | A helper class to **calculate layout geometry** (rows/cols/sizes).            |

So the relationship is:

    GridSpec → defines layout → used by Figure → which places Axes accordingly

🔄 Analogy: Think of it like a newspaper layout

    Figure = The page

    GridSpec = The blueprint for columns/boxes on that page

    Axes = Actual content boxes (articles, images) that are placed on the page using the layout

You can’t put content just in the layout — you put it in a page (Figure) using the layout (GridSpec) as a guide.
🛠️ What If It Were Allowed?

If GridSpec were allowed to own Axes directly, you'd lose:

    The context of the full page (Figure)

    Control over DPI, rendering canvas, saving, layout compression, etc.

That’s why Matplotlib strictly separates:

    Structure (Figure)

    Layout guidance (GridSpec)

    Plotting logic (Axes)

    Drawing primitives (Line2D, PathCollection, etc.)

✅ Final Summary
You might think	But actually

| You might think             | But actually                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "`GridSpec` is a container" | ❌ No, it's just layout metadata                                 |
| "`Axes` go into GridSpec"   | ❌ No, `Figure` owns `Axes`, GridSpec only helps decide where    |
| "`Figure` is optional"      | ❌ `Figure` is always required – it's the top-level drawing unit |
| "`GridSpec` could draw"     | ❌ It doesn't draw or store data, just tells where to put things |
