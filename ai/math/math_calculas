===[ Math: Derivative ]=========================================================
* At its core, a 'derivative' measures 'how something changes'. More precisely,
  it tells you the 'rate of change' of a function at any given point.

Taking a derivative means you are answring this question:
  "if I change the input a little, how much does the output change ?"

> Mathematically:  
  - Given a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells you how fast f changes
    'with respect to' x.

> [ Examples: ]
  1|> Let is say a position of a car over time is given by:
      [ f(t) = t^2 ]
  
  - This means the cars distance from home at second is t^2 meters
    the derivative is:
      [ f'(t) = 2t ]

  - at t = 4 seconds
      f(4) = 16 (car distance is 16m )
      f'(4) =  8
  
    t    | 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  | s 
    -----|------------------------|----
    f(t) | 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 | m 
    -----|------------------------|----
    f'(t)| 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8  | m/s 

  - This means at t=3 the car distance is 9m and it is moving 6 ms at this point 
  # CONCLUSION:=================================================================
  # - So, The derivative tells us the velocity — how fast the position is      |
  #   changing.                                                                |
  # ============================================================================

  - let is make the the rate of changes constant: grows constant. 
    [ f(t) = t ]
    
    - the derivation is:
      [ f'(t) = 1 ] 
  
  - This means that the speed is changing by [ 1 m/s ] at any point.

  2|> [ Cost Function: ]
      - Let’s say a company’s production cost is:
          C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.5x^2

      - Where x is the number of products made, and C is the cost in dollars.
        The derivative:
          C′(x) = 5 + x

      - This means:
        * For each additional unit made, cost increases by 5 + x dollars
        * At x=10: cost increases by 15 dollars per unit
        * It tells how marginal cost behaves

  3|> [ Population Growth: ]
      - Suppose a population grows according to:
        P(t) = 1000 * e^0.03t

      - Where t is in years. The derivative is:
        P'(t) = 1000 * 0.03 * e^0.03t

      - It tells how fast the population is growing at any time 't', and that
        growth is 'exponential'.

> [ General Patterns: ]
    _____________________________________________________________________
    | Function f(x)   | Derivative f'(x)   | Interpretation             |
    |-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
    | x^2             | 2x                 | Change grows linearly      |
    | x^3             | 3x^2               | Change grows quadratically |
    | sin(x)          | cos(x)             | Change oscillates          |
    | e^x             | e^x                | Growth matches size        |
    | ln(x)           | 1/x                | Slows as x grows           |
    |_________________|____________________|____________________________|

===[ Math: Partial Derivative ]================================================= 
* A partial derivative measures 'how a multivariable function changes with the'
  'respect to one variable while holding all the variables constant'.

  > Ex:
      f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2

  - How does 'f' change if i change 'x' a little, but keep 'y' fixed ?
    |=> that is 'the partial derivative with the respect to x' written ∂f/∂x
  - How does 'f' change if i change 'y' a littel, but keep 'x' fixed ? 
    |=> that is 'the partial derivative with the respect to y' written ∂f/∂y

# QUESTION:[ Why are partial derivative used ?]=================================
- Because many real-world systems depend on multiple variables, partial
  derivatives help us isolate the effect of just one variable.

  |____________________|_______________________________________________________|

> [ Examples: Derivative VS Partial Derivative ]
  [[[ Derivative]]]
    f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
  - This has 'one variable' x, so we use the regular derivaitve:
    f'(x) = d/dx(3x^2 + 2x + 1) = 6x + 2
  - [ This tell us the slop (rate of change) of the function at any point x ] 

 [[[ Partial Derivative ]]] 
    f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2

    | ∂f/∂x = 6x + 2y 
  --|
    | ∂f/∂y = 2x + 2y

  - These tell us:
    * How 'f' changes in the 'x direction' (slop if you walk east).
    * How 'f' changes in the 'y direction' (slop if you walk north).

  # INFO:
  # - Steep (of a slop) rising of falling at a sharp angle.
  #   ex: a steep slop
  # - Descent (Noun) a Movement down 

===[ Analogy: ]=================================================================
- Imagine you're on a hill.
- The derivative is like walking along a 1D trail — you're asking
  |=> "how steep is the path right here?"

  The partial derivative is like looking at the steepness:

  - North-South (∂f/∂y)
  - East-West (∂f/∂x)

- You are still on the hill, but you are isolating one direction at a time.

===[ In Software Term: 💻 ]======================================================
* Derivative:
  - Used when modeling simple curves or optimizing single-variable functions.

* Partial Derivative:
  - Crucial in:
    > Gradient Descent (you compute partials for each variable)
    > Neural Networks (backpropagation uses partial derivatives)
    > Physics Engines (e.g., surface normals)
    > Multivariable optimization (e.g., tuning hyperparameters)

# CONCLUSION:===================================================================
# - Derivatives are for single-variable functions.                             |
# - Partial derivatives are for multi-variable functions.                      |
# - Partial derivatives are just an extension of the derivative idea           |
#   => they measure change in one direction while holding others constant.     |

> [ Tangent line equation: ]====================================================
* If 'f' is 'differentiable' at x = a
  
  1|> Use this direct mathimathic rule to find it:
        => [ y = f'(a) * (x - a) + f(a) ] 

  2|> If 'f' is 'differentiable' at x=a => the slop is a so the equation is:
        (1) => [ y = f'(a) * x + b ]
      - The point (a, f(a)) belong to f(x) and tangent line equation, so: 
            => [ f(a) = f'(a) * a + b]
        (2) => [ b = f(a) - f'(a) * a ] 
      - from (1) and (2):
        f(x) = f'(a) * x - f'(a) * a + f(a)  
  =====> [ y = f'(a) * (x - a) + f(a) ]: This is the first equation 
  # NOTE:=============================================================
  # - the second section is the proof for the first equation:        |
  #   |=> [ y = f'(a) * (x - a) + f(a) ]                             |
  # ==================================================================

  # INFO:=============================================================
  # - You can write f'(x), dy/dx or f'(x) * dx = dy                  |
  # ==================================================================

===[ Why limits introduced in math ?: ]=========================================
* Limits were created to solve a big problem in 'calculus' and 'analysis'.

  'How do we deal with values that constantly changing, especially when they'
  'get extremly close to something -- but never actually reach it ?'

===[ Problem: ]===
* Imagine you are trying to measure 'how fast' something is moving at an exact
  moment.
- let's say a car drives 100 km in 2 hours - that is 50km/h.
- But what if you want to know the exact speed at a single moment, like at t = 1
hour?
You can’t measure it directly, because speed is based on how distance changes
over time. Instead, you look at the average speed over smaller and smaller
time intervals around t = 1. Then, you use a limit to figure out what value the
speed is approaching as the interval gets closer and closer to zero. That gives
you the instantaneous speed.
# NOTE: It is about finding the instantaneous speed(sor3a lahdiya)
- The smaller the interval, the more accurate your answer gets. But this raises
  the question:
  'What happens as the time interval gets closer and closer to zero?'

- This "approaching" behavior is 'not easy to define'using regular math, You
  need a way to 'talk about a value you are getting close to' even if you
  never each it.

# CONCLUSION:===================================================================
# - Limits give us a precise way to say:                                       |
# - 'As X gets closer and closer to some value, Y get closer and closer to this|
#   other value'                                                               | 
# So in this example:                                                          | 
# - As the time interval approaches to t=1h, the average speed appraoches the  |
#   'instantaneous speed'.                                                     | 
# - This idea helps define:                                                    |
#   . Instantaneous speed (used in derivatives)                                |
#   . Area under curves (used in integrals)                                    |

# QUESTION:[ If the derivative gives me V(t), why do I need limits? ]===========
- You can’t get a derivative without limits — because the derivative is the
  limit of average rates of change.
- The 'derivative is defined as a limit' 
- Without the concept of a limit, we could not rigorously define what a
  derivative means. 
# QUESTION:[ Why not just say "derivative"? ]===================================
- We do -- but behind the scenes, every derivative relies on a limit.
- Derivative is a 'shortcut' to calculate the rate of cchange at a at x E R.
- Limits allows as to calculate at specific point, The derivatie is another
  shortcut that calculate the derivative in interval.

# WARNING:[ When the point is not differentiable: ]=============================
# - f'(x) = 0 DOES NOT MEAN that f is not differentiable at x. 
#   > Ex: 
#     f(x) = |x|
#         |
#         |
#     \   |   /
#      \  |  /
#       \ | /
#        \|/____________ (x)
#         0
# - f'(x = 0) is not differentiable 
# QUESTION:Why we can't just say the rate of change is 0 when a function is not
# differentiable at a point ?]==================================================
# - At x = 0:
#   . The left-hand slope is -1 (from f(x)=−x for x<0)
#   . The right-hand slope is +1 (from f(x)=x for x>0)
# - Since the left and right derivatives are not equal, the overall derivative
#   does not exist at x = 0.
#===[ Analogy: ]================================================================
# - Imagine you’re standing at a sharp corner on a path.
#   Can you say the path is "flat" there? No — there’s no single direction you
#   are facing. Same with a function: at a sharp point, the slope isn’t 0 — it’s
#   undefined.

  2|>lim(x->a+) f(x) - f(a) / x - a = l <-> lim(x->a+) f(x) - f(a) / x - a = c
      - f is derivate at the right of a | y = R * (x - a) + f(a)  
      - f is derivate at the left of a  | y = L * (x - a) + f(a)

===[ Exponential Function: ]====================================================
* An 'exponential function' is a function where the varibale is the 'exponent' 

      >> [     F(X) = a^X      ] << 

  - 'a': is 'positive constant base (a > 0, a != 1)' 
  - 'x': is the 'exponent variable' 

- The base value 'a == 2.71828' is a special constant in mathematics. 
  
  # NOTE:=======================================================================
  # - The number a = 2.71828 is a unique number found by someone called 'Auler'.
  # - e ≈ 2.71828 is a special constant in mathematics.

- The 'exponential function' with base e == 2.71828 is a special function called
  'natural exponential function' and is unique because:

    [    d                 ]
    [   ---- e^x = e^x     ]
    [    dx                ]

    -  e^x = f'(x) = y = e * e * ... * e 
                         \-------------/
                            x times

  # NOTE:=======================================================================
  # - It is the only exponential function whos rate fo change equals it value 
  #   making it essential in 'calculus, differential equations' and
  #   'growth modeling'.
  # INFO:=======================================================================
  # - Any exponential a^x can be rewritten using base e: 
  #   [ a^x = e^x.ln(a) ]

  > [ Properties of Exponential functions: ]
    - 'Always positive': f(x) > 0 
    - 'Rapid growth': (a > 1): the bigger x gets the faster f(x) increases 
    - 'Exponential decay': (if 0 < a < 1): the function rapidly shrinks as x
                           increases. 
    - 'Domain': All real numbers (−∞,∞)
    - 'Range': (0, ∞) 
    - Y-intercept: 'Always f(0) = 1' for any base 'a' 

===[ Logarithms: The inverse of exponentials ]=== 
* 'A logarithm' is the 'inverse of an exponential function':

    => [ b^x = y    <==>   logb(y) = x   ] 

  - In case of 'natural exponential function' 

    => [ y = f(x) = e^x   <==>  loge(y) = x ] 

  # TIP:========================================================================
  # - The inverse function of natural exponential function is called natural
  #   logarihm ln(x):
  #       [ loge(x) = ln(x) ]
  # - Rules: 
  #   ln(e^x) = x  and e^ln(x) = x
  # ============================================================================

# QUESTION:[ Why are These Concepts Important ?]================================ 
# - 'Exponential functions': model real-world processes (e.g population growth,
#   radioactive decay, interest rates, learning curves, etc) 
# - 'Euler's number': makes formulas in calculus simple and elegant.
# - 'Logarithms': are used to solve equations involving exponentials. 
# - 'Natural logs (ln)': show up in integration, derivatives, and statistical
#   distributions (like normal and exponential)
