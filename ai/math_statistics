===[ Statistics: ]============================================================== 
* Statistics is branch of mathematics that deals with 'collecting', 'analyzing',
  'interpreting', 'presenting' and organizing 'data'.  
  - It helps us 'make sense of large amounts of data' and 'make decisions or'
    'predictions' based on that data.

            |-------------[ Statistics Types: ]-------------------| 
            |                                                     |

[ Descriptive Statistics: ]                        [ Inferential Statistics: ]
-> Summarize and describe the main            -> Make predictions about a larger 
   feature of dataset.                           population from a smaller sample
-> Examples:                                  -> Examples:  
   . Mean (average)                              . Estimating population averages 
   . Median (middle value)                         (using a sample)
   . Mode (most frequent value)                  . hypotheses testing (A/B testing)
   . Range (difference between                   . Confidence intervals
     highest and lowest)                         . Regression analysis
   . Standard Deviation (How spread
     out the values are) 
   . Graphs and Charts (histograms,
     pie charts) 

===[ Descriptive Statistics: ]==================================================

===[ Cases and variables: ]===
* A 'case' is one unit of 'observation' 

  - Examples:
    . A person 
    . A company 
    . A country
    . A product 
    . An event

  # INFO: each row in a dataset represent a case

  * A 'variable' is a 'characteristic' or 'property' that is measured for each
    case.
    - Example:
      . person: hight, age, gender ... etc

  # INFO:
  # - varibales are the column in your dataset. 
  # - varibales can be 'quantitaive' (numbers like age etc) or 'qualitaitve'
  #   (categoris like gender male or female)

  > [ Dataset Example: ]  
    _____________________________________________
    | Car Model | Year | Price ($)  | Fuel Type |
    |-----------|------| -----------|-----------|
    | Toyota    | 2020 | 18,000     | Gasoline  |
    | Tesla     | 2022 | 45,000     | Electric  |
    | Honda     | 2019 | 15,000     | Hybrid    |
    |___________|______|____________|___________|

    - Cases: each 'car' is case (3 cars == 3 cases)  
    - Varibales: Car model, Year, Price, Fuel Type (4 varibles for each case) 

  # CONCLUSION:
  # - Case = on item/subject you are collecting data on (a row)  
  # - Varibale =  one characteristic of a case column 

===[ Level of Measurements: ]===

===[ Data Matrix & Frequency Table ]===

# REVISION:
# - case is one unit of observation (person or thing)
# - varibales are the characteristic of the case  

* Data Matrix & Frequency Table are 'foundational tools for organizing and'
  'summarizing data'.

  > [ Data Matrix: ]
    * is a structured format for storing raw data, typically in rows and columns
      where: 
      . Columns: varibales 
      . Rows: cases 

  > [ Examples: ]
    _________________________________
    | Person | Age | Gender | Score |
    |--------|-----|--------|-------|
    | 1      | 23  | M      | 88    |
    | 2      | 30  | F      | 92    |
    | 3      | 25  | M      | 85    |
    |________|_____|________|_______|

    . rows: cases (person 1, person 2 ...)
    . columns: varibales (Age, Gender and Score)  

> [ Table Frequency: (Frequency: ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ÿßÿ±)]
  - It simplifies the large datasets by 'summarizes' how each value or category
    of a varibale occurs. 

  |> Usage:
      . Simplfies large datasets
      . Identifies patterns, trends, or outliers 
      . Helps visualize the distribution of data
        => Often used with historgrams or bar charts
      . Enables quick calculation of:
        - Mode 
        - Relative Frequency
        - Comulative frequency 

  > [ Examples: ] 
    _________________________________________________
    | Grade | Frequency | Percentage %| Cumulative %|
    |-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
    | A     | 10        |    28       |    28       |
    | B     | 15        |    43       |    71       |
    | C     | 8         |    23       |    94       |
    | D     | 2         |     6       |    100      |
    |_______|___________|_____________|_____________|
    | Total |   35      |   100%      |    100%     | 

# NOTE:
# - Matrix table is the source to start anaylsis
# - Frequency table is good to display the data where we can provide summary
#   for the dataset
# - You can use the ghraphs to summarize the data


              [ Graphs: Catigorical Varibales ] 
                              |
        |---------------------|---------------------|
    [ Pie chart ]                               [ Bar Graph]
- It is 'circular char'                  - It displays 'catigorical data' 
  divided into 'slices'                    with rectangular bars
  where each slice                       - bar can be vertical or horizontal 
  represents a 'proprotion'              - The x-axis shows categories
  of the totoal                          - The y-axis shows values (frequency
- The whole circle reprsents               , percentage) 
  100% of the data                       - Bars are 'separated' to show they 
- each slice is sized according            represetn distinct categories.
  the the 'relative frequency'           > [ Usage: ]
  (percentage)                             - Camparing 'discrete categories' 
> [ Usage: ]                                 (gender, type of fruite etc)
  - Showing 'percentage'                   - Highlighting difference in quantity
  - When the goal is to                      across groups.
    visualize 'how a whole is'
    'divided' into parts

# NOTE:
# - If the number of variables is large the bar grpah is better than the
#   pie graph   
# - Ghraphs are good for the case of catigorical varibales (nominal level)

> [ Dot Plot: Numerical/Quantitive Varibales ]
* A dot plot is simple way to show 'frequency of data' using 'dots' each dot represents 'one occurrence' of a value in dataset. 
- It is best for 'small moderate sets of numerical data' especially discret
  data. 

  > [ Example: ]
    - Let‚Äôs say you ask 10 students how many books they read last month.
      The data is:
      2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4

      Number of Books Read
      2: ‚óè‚óè‚óè
      3: ‚óè‚óè‚óè
      4: ‚óè‚óè
      5: ‚óè‚óè

        Or

      2   3   4   5
      ‚óè‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè

  # CONCLUSION:
  # - A dot plot is a quick and clear way to show how often each value occurs.
  # - It‚Äôs great for small data sets and helps spot patterns easily.
  # - Each dot = one observation.

  > [ Histogram ]
    * A histogram is a type of graph that shows the 'distribution of a dataset',
      It looks similar to a 'bar graph' but it is used for 'continuous'
      numerical data rather than categories.

# TIP:
# - You should always convert quentitive variables to catigorical varibale by using intervales 
# - Examples: wieght
#  
#  person 1: 80.9 
#  person 2: 70
#  person 3: 40.5
#  person 5: 90.1 
#  ...
# - To best way to visualize the data is to convert the continous varibale to 
#   intervals 0 -> 20 | 20 -> 40 | 40 -> 60 | 60 -> 80 | 80 -> 100  
  > [ Usage: ]
    - To show the shape of data: symmetrical, skewed, bimodal, etc.
    - To identify patterns, such as:
      * Central tendency (where values cluster)
      * Spread (how wide the data is)
      * Outliers or gaps

# CONCLUSION:[ GLOBAL ]=========================================================
# - Ghraphs is used to visualize, sammarize and clear observation from the data
# - [Nominal/Ordinal] => Piechart or Bar Ghraph  
# - [Interval/Ratio]  => Dot Plot or Histogram
