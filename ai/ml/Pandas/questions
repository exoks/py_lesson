That's a great question, and you're absolutely right—terms like intersection and union are often more intuitive, especially for beginners.

Let’s break it down:
💬 Why terms like inner, outer, left, and right are used?

These terms come directly from relational databases (SQL) — the origin of the "join" concept.
Join Type	What It Means (in simple terms)
inner	Keep only rows that match in both tables (intersection)
outer	Keep all rows from both tables, fill in NaN if no match (full union)
left	Keep all rows from the left table, match from right
right	Keep all rows from the right table, match from left
🧠 Why not just say intersection and union?

Good point!

✅ Pros of your idea:

    intersection and union are clearer for people with math/set theory background.

    Simpler mental model: “what’s common” vs “everything”.

🚫 Why Pandas (and SQL) use the other terms:

    left, right, inner, and outer allow more precise control.

    intersection/union don’t cover directional joins:

        Example: in left join, only keep left table's rows even if there's no match in right.

So basically:

    🔹 intersection = inner join
    🔹 union = outer join
    🔹 left join = union only favoring the left side
    🔹 right join = union favoring the right side

📊 Visual Summary (Venn-style):

LEFT JOIN
╭─────────────╮
│   Left DF   │
│ ┌───────┐   │
│ │       │   │   Keep all rows from Left
│ │   ∩   │───┤   + matching rows from Right
│ │       │   │
│ └───────┘   │
╰─────────────╯

INNER JOIN
Only the ∩ (intersection)

OUTER JOIN
Everything (∪), even if no match

🟢 TL;DR

    Yes — intersection/union would be more intuitive.

    But SQL (and thus Pandas) uses inner, outer, left, and right for precision and flexibility.

    Once you think of:

        inner = intersection

        outer = full union

        left = “everything from the left side”

        right = “everything from the right side”

…it becomes easier to grasp!
