===[ QUESTIONS: ]===============================================================

===[ Additive Models VS Predective Models ]===
Additive models:
Think of them like recipes. A time series is explained as the sum of different
ingredients:

Time¬†Series=Trend+Seasonality+Random¬†Noise
Time¬†Series=Trend+Seasonality+Random¬†Noise

Example: Ice cream sales = long-term growth (trend) + summer effect (seasonality) + random variations.
These models don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù from data patterns in a complex way ‚Äî they decompose the series into parts we can understand.

Predictive models:
These are more like black boxes that learn from past data to predict the future. They don‚Äôt necessarily split the series into components; instead, they learn rules or patterns.
Example: Using ARIMA, SARIMA, or a machine learning model (like XGBoost, LSTM) to forecast next month‚Äôs sales.

üëâ In short:

Additive models = explain structure (descriptive).

Predictive models = forecast future values (predictive).

===[ Seasonality Deep Understanding ]===
üü¢ Intuitive Explanation

Seasonality means: 'the data' has a 'repeating pattern at regular intervals'.

  . Example: Ice cream sales are always higher in summer and lower in winter.
  . Example: Electricity demand spikes every evening when people come home.

- It‚Äôs not just one number (like a scalar). Instead, it‚Äôs a pattern that
  repeats‚Äîso think of it like a ‚Äúshape‚Äù that the time series follows again and
  again.

üîµ Technical Explanation
  - In time series models, seasonality is usually represented as:

Additive model:


 is the seasonal component, often defined as a function repeating with period 
P
P (e.g., 12 months, 7 days, 24 hours).

Example: If monthly seasonality exists with period 
P=12
P=12, then:

Multiplicative model:


 scales the series proportionally.

Representation:

In decomposition ‚Üí 
St
S
t

 is usually a vector of seasonal factors (one per time step in the cycle).

In statistical models (like SARIMA) ‚Üí seasonality enters as lagged terms at multiples of the seasonal period.

In ML models (like Prophet) ‚Üí seasonality can be modeled as a sum of sine and cosine functions (Fourier terms).

So, seasonality is not a single scalar, but rather a systematic repeating structure that can be expressed as:

A periodic function (sinusoids, indicator dummies, Fourier terms).

A set of seasonal factors (one per period).

‚úÖ Summary:

Seasonality = repeating patterns in time series.

Represented as a function of time with fixed periodicity, not just a scalar.

Practically, it‚Äôs encoded as a cycle of values (e.g., monthly factors), or as periodic functions in models.
