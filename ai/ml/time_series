# QUESTION:[ ESTIMATION VS PREDICTION VS FORECASTING ]==========================
# - ESTIMATION: Focues on 'current or past values' not future onces. 
# - PREDICTION: can be future or unseen inputs, but does not necessarily account
#               for time order.
# - FORCASTING: Always 'time-dependent', often handles trends, seasonality and
#   cycles.
# _____________________________________________________________________________
# | Concept     | Time-     | Focus               | Example                   |
# |             |dependent? |                     |                           |
# |-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
# | Estimation  | No        | Current/past values | Average sales last month  |
# | Prediction  | Maybe     | Specific outcome    | Will it rain tomorrow?    |
# | Forecasting | Yes       | Future over time    | Next month‚Äôs bakery sales |
# |_____________|___________|_____________________|___________________________|
# - Forcasting = making predictions about 'future or unknown values' based on
#   'patterns in past or known data'.
# NOTE:[ IMPORTANT NOTES ]------------------------------------------------------
# - The data does not have to be tied to time
# - Time Series Forcasting (Special Case)
# - When data is not tied to time, forecasting looks very similar to
#   'regression' or 'predictions tasks' in ML. 
#   . Forecasting 'house prices' based on features (size, location, rooms)
#   . Forecasting 'product dement' from product attributes, not necessarily from 
#     time.
# - All time series forcasting is 'forcasting', But not all forcasting are time 
#   series.
# - [ Time series analysis = statistical field (older than ML) ]
# - [ Time series forecasting = can use ML methods             ]
# INFO:[ Time Series in Machine Learning ]-------------------------------------- 
# - ML models can be applied to time series, but ML itself is 'not required' for
#   time series analysis.
# - Modern ML methods for time series:
#   . Regression models using 'lagged features'.
#   . Random Forest/XGBoost on time-based feature. 
#   . Neural networks (RNN, LSTM, Temporal CNN) 
# - Here, 'time series becomes a supervised ML problem': past -> future mapping 
# CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Forcasting: "What will happen in the future?"
# - Predection: "What is the target value given these inputs?" 
# - Estimation: "What are the hidden parameters that explain my data?" 

===[ Forcasting: ]==============================================================
* 'Forcasting' means 'making an informed prediction' about the future based on
  'past and present' data
  - Forecasting works because:
    . 'History influence the future'.
    . Data often follows 'patterns' (daily, weekly, seasonal, economic cycles) 

  # NOTE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - Forecasting is perhaps the most common application of machine learning
  #   in the real world.

  # INFO:-------------------------------------------------------------
  # - forcasting (noun): the job or activity of judging what is likely
  #   to happen in the future, based on the information you have now:

# CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Once data is related to 'time', the concept changes because observations are
#   no longer "independent": they become 'sequentially dependent', so you need
#   'time series forcasting' instead of regular prediction.
# - Forcasting = using past + present information to make predictions about the 
#   future, usually in situations where time plays a role.
# - In short Forcasting is a type of predection 'specifically for future values
#   over time' using historical data patterns.

  > [ Simple Example: ]
    * Imagine you run a small bakery:
      - You sold 50 bread on Monday
      - 55 on Tuesday 
      - 53 on Wednesday
      - 60 on Thursday.

  - If you want to know 'how many bread to bake on Friday', you don't just guess
    randomly, you look at the 'past sales trend' ->> around 50-60 per day
  |-> That "educated guess" for Friday's sales is a "forecast".

===[ Forcasting Time Series Models ]============================================
* 'Time Series Analysis' Concept is a concept that data scientist tackle in
  their job
  - These are different approach to make prediction in case of time series

# QUESTION:[ time series are always related the concept of forcasting, Why? ]===
# * A 'time series' is simply a "sequence of data points collected over time 
#   usually at equal intervals".
#   - Examples
#     . Daily freight volume at a port
#     . Montly sales
#     . Hourly electricity demand 
#     . Yearly population counts
#   formaly it is:
#     [ X = {x1, x2, x4, ..., xt} ]
#     where `xt` is the value observed at time `t`
# * Forcasting is the 'process' of using historical data to predict future
#   values.
#   > If the data is a 'time series' type, then we call it
#     |==> time series forcasting <===|
#   # NOTE:>--------------------------------------------------------------------
#   # - forecasting can also apply to 'non-time' data
# CONCLUSION:[ Relationship between 'time series' and 'forcasting' ]============
# - Time Series -> the type of data (ordered in time)   | data structure
# - Forcasting  -> the task (predecting future values)  | the predection task
# - Time Series Forcasting -> A specific type of forcasting where the input data 
#   is 'time-dependent (time series)'
# - in simple word Predection of future points (values) in a time-ordered
#   dataset (time series) 
# REVISION:> Forcasting is predection technique as 'Estimation' and 'Prediction'

  # INFO:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - Uni-variate model means that the model deals with single time series 
  #   variable. 
  # - Multi-Variate model can handle multi-time series variable.
  # - Uni/Multi-variate model use depends on number of values we are predecting. 

  # NOTE:[ VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ]------------------------------------------ 
  # - All This model and approach that we have mentiend so far are treated
  #   as time series problem. this one can be converted as traditional  
  #   machine learning regression model. 

===[ ARIMA Model ]===
* 'ARIMA' stands for 'Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average' it is a
  forecasting technique used to predict future data based on past data, especially 
  for things that change over time (like sales)
  - The model contains three parts:
    1|> `AR` (AutoRegressive) 
    2|> `I`  (Integrated) 
    3|> `MA` (Moving Average)
  - In simple ARIMA combines patterns (AR), trends(I), and corrections for
    surprises (MA) to make your `X` predictions as accurate as possible.

===[ SARIMA Model ]===
* 'SARIMA' stands  for 'Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average' is
  extension of ARIMA that adds the ability to handle 'seasonality' (recurring
  patterns like weekly, monthly, yearly cycles).
  - Good choise when:
    . Your data show 'trend' (increasing/decreasing pattern)
    . Your data shows 'seasonality (repeated cycles): daily, weekly, yearly' 
    # NOTE:[ THE Last ONE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ]==================
    . You want an interpretable, classical model before moving to complex ML/DL 
      models

    - Advantages of SARIMA:
      . Handles 'trend + seasonality' explicitly.
      . Works well for 'small to medium datasets'. 
      . Provides 'statistical interpretability' (you can explain coefficients) 
      . Often a 'Strong baseline' before trying ML/DL models 

  > [ Using in Python ]

    pip install statsmodels

# NOTE:[ VERY IMPORTANT NOTES ]-------------------------------------------------
# - Regular EDA often ignores order and focuses on distributions, correlations,
#   and missing values.

===[ Time Series Analysis ]=====================================================

===[ Stationarity ]===
* A 'stationary time series' has statistical properties that 'do not change'
  'over time', mathematically means:
  - 'Constant mean' over time ('constant (no-long term trend)') 
  - 'Constant variance' over time

  # QUESTION:[ But Why does it matter ?]-------------------------------------
  # - Many classical time series models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA), <assume
  #   stationarity> because they relay on stable patterns to make predections
  # - If the series is <non-stationary> (trends, changing variance), these
  #   models my give 'biased or meaningless forecasts'.

                      [ Stationarity  Types ]
                                 |
          |----------------------|--------------------| 
          |                                           |
  [ Strict stationarity ]                     [ Weak / Covariance stationarity ]
- the 'entire distrubution' series           - Only 'mean', 'variance', and  
  is unchanged over time.                      'autocorrelation' are constant
  (rare in practice)                           (commonly used in practice)

  # CONCLUSION:>----------------------------------------------------------------
  # Stationarity = series has stable 'statistical properties over time', which
  # is essential for many time series models to work properly.

[ 'Variance' Transformation: Log && Box-Cox ]===
1|> [ Log Transformation]
  * you can simply use natural 'np.log' () transform the variance 

  # NOTE:> Make sure to stationize 'variance' first and then 'mean'. 

  - np.log(data['VOL_TRAFIC']) => another transformed dataframe

2|> [ Box-Cox transformation ]
  Box-Cox (Box Clock) transformation is a statistical technique used in
  'time series analysis (and general ML/Stats)', to make data more 
  'normal-like' and often more 'stationary'.

  from scipy.stats import boxcox

  data['TRAFIC_VOL_BOX_COX'], lam = boxcox(data['TRAFFIC_VOL'])

[ Differencing: Make Transformation to mean ('trend') ]===
* To make 'trend' mean constant
                  
          [       d(t) = y(t) - y(t - 1)      ]

  - in pandas use function .diff() | data['TRAFFIC_VOL'].diff() 

[ Stationarity test: READ ABOUT THIS Subject ]===
????


===[ Seasonality: ]===
* 'seasonality' is just as fundamental in time series as 'trend' or
  'stationarity'.
  - A time series is 'seasonal' if it shows predictable changes that recure
    every fixed period (day, week, month, year...).
  - Examples:
    . Weekly: shopping patterns (weekend spikes)
    . Daily: electricity demand (higher at night/daytime peaks) 

  # QUESTION:[ Why Seasonality Important? ]-------------------------------------
  # 1. Model Assumption: many forecasting models (like ARIMA) assume
  #    stationarity, 'Strong seasonality makes the series' non-stationary. 
  # 2. Bias in Forecast: if seasonality is ignored, forecasts may systematically  
  #    over/understimate during seasonal peaks and throughs.
  # 3. Business Insight: Seasonality explains why something happens (ex, sales
  #    in December not because of trend, but because of holidays) 
  # > [ Example ]
  # - Imagine monthly sales data:
  #   . Trend = increasing over years
  #   . Seasonality = spike every December (holidays)
  #   . Residual = random noise
  # - If you model without seasonality, the model might think December spikes
  #   are "trend," leading to poor predictions in other months.
  # - If you model with seasonality, it correctly adjusts for the December jump.

[ Handling Seasonality: ]===
1|> Transformation
    - Removing => [ d(t) = y(t) - y(t - m) ] => use 'pandas.diff(periods=nbr)'
    - Decomposition 
2|> Using Models that handle seasonality (e.g, SARIMA) 

===[ Decomposition ]===
* 'decomposition' means 'breaking down' a 'complex series' into simpler,
  interpretable 'componenents'. 
  # NOTE:>-------------------------------------------------------------
  # This help us understand underlying patterns rather than just seeing
  # a noisy curve
  - A time Series Y(t) is usually modeled as:

    [   Yt = T(t) + S(t) + R(t)   ] -> 'Additive model' 
    - When 'seasonal variations' are 'constant' over time. 
                OR
    [   Yt = T(t) * S(t) * R(t)   ] -> 'Multiplicative model'  
    - When 'seasonal variations' 'grow/shrink' with the 'level' of the
      series.

    1. 'Trend': T(t): the long-term direction of data (upward, downward, flat)
        example: sales increasing over years.
    2. 'Seasonality': S(t): repeating, predictable patterns at fixed intervals.  
    3. 'Residual/Noise': R(t) random 'fluctuations' left after removing trend
                         and seasonality.
                         
    # INFO:-------------------------------------------------------------
    # - Fluctuation: (noun) ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇŸÑÿ®, a change of the process of changing,
    #   especially continuously between one level or thing and another. 

  > [ Transformation from multiplicative to addictive ]
    - Use log or box-cox transformation to transform and stabilize the
      'variance', once the variance is stabilized the model becomes 'additive'.

# CONCLUSION:[ Decomposition Goal ]---------------------------------------------
# - To analyze each part separately (trend forecasting, seasonality 
#   understanding, noise detection)
# - To prepare data for forecasting models like `SARIMA`, `Prophet`, etc. 

  > [ How Decomposition is done in practice? ]
  - There are multiple algorithms and methods to decompose the time series into
    the three componenets, i want to go over the classic one, 

    
    1. Compute the trand componenet, T, using a 'moving/rolling' average. and
       then 'De-trend (remove)' the series, 'Y-T' for 'additive' model, 'Y/T'
       for 'multiplicative' model.
    2. Compute the Seasonal componenet S, by taking the average of the
       'de-trended' series for each season. 
    3. 'The Residual componenet R', is calculated as 'R=Y-T-S' for additive
       model and 'R=Y/(TS)' for multiplicative model. 
    # NOTE:> Calculate components and then remove it, and then calculate and
    #        remove it ... 
   
    - In python:

        # Import the seasonal decompose function 
        from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

        plot_multi = seasonal_decompose(data['seasonal'],
                                  model='additive/multiplicative') 
        # It will show all different componenets (T), (S), (R) in different
        # subplots 
        plot_multi.plot()
        plt.show()


    # INFO:>---------------------------------------------------------------
    # THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER METHODS AVAILABLE FOR DECOMPOSITION such as 
    # STL, X11, and SEATS, These are advanced methods and add to the basic
    # approach from the classical method and improve upon its shortcomings.

===[ Autocorelation (ACF): Autocorelation function ]===
* 'Autocorelation' is one of the most 'tools' in time 'series analysis'
  and the 'core of time series analysis'.
  - 'Autocorrelation' (is also called 'serial correlation') 'measures' how   
    'related' a time series is with its 'own past values'.
  - In simple words: if todays value is strongly related to yesterday (or
    last week s, last month s) the series has 'autocorrelation'
  - It is just 'correlation', but instead of comparing two different variables,
    you compare a variable with its 'lagged versions'.

    [            Cov (Yt, Yt-k)           ]
    [    pk =   ------------------        ]
    [               simga^2               ]

  # NOTE:> IT is very simple and close to PEARSON'R correlation concept
  # - Pk is the correlation
  #   +1 -> perfect postive correlation (past and present move together)
  #   < +1 -> strong positive correlation 
  #   -1 -> perfect negative correlation (past up, present down)
  #   > -1 -> strong negative correlation 
  #   0  -> no correlation

  # QUESTION:[ What is a 'lag' in time series? ]---------------------------------
  # - A 'lag' is just a shift backward in time. It means "how many steps back in
  #   the past we look at to compare with the present"
  #   . 'Lag 1': yesterday compared to today
  #   . 'Lag 2': two days ago compared to today
  #   . 'Lag 12': 12 monts ago compared to this month
  # - Example:
  #   ___________________
  #   | Day | Temp (¬∞C) |
  #   |-----| ----------|
  #   | 1   | 22        |
  #   | 2   | 24        |
  #   | 3   | 23        |
  #   | 4   | 25        |
  #   |_____|___________|
  # - At lag 1 -> compare day2 with day1, day3 with day2, day4 with day3 
  # - At lag 2 -> compare day3 with da1, day4 with day2
  # So, lag="the time gap between the two values we are comparing"
  #üîπ Why it matters
  #   . If a series has high correlation at lag 1, it means yesterday strongly
  #     influences today (good for autoregressive models).
  #   . If there‚Äôs a spike at lag 7, maybe the data has weekly seasonality.
  # CONCLUSION:[ Analogy ]------------------------------------------------------
  # - A 'lag' is like a memory -- how much the past influences the present, with
  #   the number telling you how far back you look.

# CONCLUSION:[ PURPOSE ]--------------------------------------------------------
# - Detects 'patterns & dependencies' in data  
# - Helps idenfity 'seasonality' (e.g. high correlation at lag=12 months, yearly
#   seasonality) 
# - Used in model Building (AR, ARIMA, SARIMA rely heavily on autocorrelation)
#   detect how many lags to use to build the models.

[ Autocorelation In Python ]===
    from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

    plot_acf(data['TRAFFIC_VOLM'], lags=nbr)

    plt.show() 

# INFO:[ TOOLS ]----------------------------------------------------------------
# - ACF (AutoCorrelation Function): shows correlations at different lags. 
# - PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function): shows direct effect of a lag, 
#   removing intermediate effects.
# > [ Exmaple Intuition ]
#   . If ice cream sales today are highly correlated with sales yesterday
#     (lag 1), we‚Äôll see a strong autocorrelation at lag 1.
#   . If sales follow a 'weekly pattern', lags at 7, 14, 21‚Ä¶ will show peaks in
#     the autocorrelation function. 
# üëâ These plots are standard for diagnosing which ARIMA/SARIMA parameters to use

===[ Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) ]===
- 'Autocorrelation': Measures how current values are related to past values
  (lags)
- 'Partial Autocorrelation (PACF)': Measures the correlation between a value
  and its lag. 'after removing the effect of shorter lags' 
  > Example:
    . Autocorrelation at lag 5 includes effects from lags 1-4
    . Partial autocorrelation at lag 5 removes those and shows the 
      'direct relationship' between `Yt` and `Yt - 5`

# QUESTION:[ Why it is important? ]---------------------------------------------
# - In 'ARIMA/SARIMA modeling', PACF helps choose the 'order of the AR
#   (AutoRegressive) term'.
#   . If PACF cuts off after lag 'p', it suggests AR(p) might be appropriate
# - ACF (Autocorrelation Function): on the other hand, helps choose the 'MA'
#   (Moving Average) term
# > So
#   . PACF -> AR terms
#   . ACF  -> MA terms
