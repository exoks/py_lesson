[ Decorator: ] : is a function that wraps another function, it taks function (arg) & use it inside of it 
  syntax:
    def decorator()
      pass

    @decorator
    def fun()
      pass
 
NOTE: decorator() function is wraper for fun() function
Question: does the decorator a call back function ? 
ANSWER: no, they are somewhat related becasue both involve passing one function to another.

|             <Decorator: func modifier>            |                      <CallBack>                  |
|-function that takes another function and return a | - function that is passed to another to get exec | 
|modified function of it.                           | later                                            |
