Great question! scikit-learn has many models, and organizing them clearly can help a lot. Here's a complete and logical classification of all major scikit-learn models, grouped by learning type and algorithm family ‚Äî excluding deep learning, since scikit-learn doesn't focus on neural networks.
üîµ 1. Linear Models

Used for both regression and classification.
Task	Models
Regression	LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, BayesianRidge, HuberRegressor, SGDRegressor
Classification	LogisticRegression, RidgeClassifier, SGDClassifier, Perceptron
