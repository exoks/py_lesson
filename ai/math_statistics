===[ Statistics: ]============================================================== 
* Statistics is branch of mathematics that deals with 'collecting', 'analyzing',
  'interpreting', 'presenting' and organizing 'data'.  
  - It helps us 'make sense of large amounts of data' and 'make decisions or'
    'predictions' based on that data.

            |-------------[ Statistics Types: ]-------------------| 
            |                                                     |

-> Summarize and describe the main          -> Make predictions about a larger 
   feature of dataset.                         population from a smaller sample
-> Examples:                                -> Examples:  
   . Mean (average)                            . Estimating population averages
   . Median (middle value)                       (using a sample)
   . Mode (most frequent value)                . hypotheses testing(A/B testing)
   . Range (difference between                 . Confidence intervals
     highest and lowest)                         . Regression analysis
   . Standard Deviation (How spread
     out the values are) 
   . Graphs and Charts (histograms,
     pie charts) 

===[ Descriptive Statistics: ]==================================================

===[ Cases and variables: ]===
* A 'case' is one unit of 'observation' 

  - Examples:
    . A person 
    . A company 
    . A country
    . A product 
    . An event

  # INFO: each row in a dataset represent a case

  * A 'variable' is a 'characteristic' or 'property' that is measured for each
    case.
    - Example:
      . person: hight, age, gender ... etc

  # INFO:=======================================================================
  # - varibales are the column in your dataset. 
  # - varibales can be 'quantitive' (numbers like age etc) or 'categorative'.
  #   (categoris like gender male or female).
  # ============================================================================

  > [ Dataset Example: ]  
    _____________________________________________
    | Car Model | Year | Price ($)  | Fuel Type |
    |-----------|------| -----------|-----------|
    | Toyota    | 2020 | 18,000     | Gasoline  |
    | Tesla     | 2022 | 45,000     | Electric  |
    | Honda     | 2019 | 15,000     | Hybrid    |
    |___________|______|____________|___________|

    - Cases: each 'car' is case (3 cars == 3 cases)  
    - Varibales: Car model, Year, Price, Fuel Type (4 varibles for each case) 

  # CONCLUSION:=================================================================
  # - Case = on item/subject you are collecting data on (a row). 
  # - Varibale =  one characteristic of a case column. 
  # ============================================================================

===[ Data Matrix & Frequency Table ]===

# REVISION:============================================
# - case is one unit of observation (person or thing).|
# - varibales are the characteristic of the case.     | 
# =====================================================

* Data Matrix & Frequency Table are 'foundational tools for organizing and'
  'summarizing data'.

  > [ Data Matrix: ]
    * is a structured format for storing raw data, typically in rows and columns
      where: 
      . Columns: varibales 
      . Rows: cases 

  > [ Examples: ]
    _________________________________
    | Person | Age | Gender | Score |
    |--------|-----|--------|-------|
    | 1      | 23  | M      | 88    |

    |________|_____|________|_______|

    . rows: cases (person 1, person 2 ...)
    . columns: varibales (Age, Gender and Score)  

> [ Table Frequency: (Frequency: ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ÿßÿ±)]
  - It simplifies the large datasets by 'summarizes' how each value or category
    of a varibale occurs. 

  |> Usage:
      . Simplfies large datasets
      . Identifies patterns, trends, or outliers 
      . Helps visualize the distribution of data
        => Often used with historgrams or bar charts
      . Enables quick calculation of:
        - Mode 
        - Relative Frequency
        - Comulative frequency 

  > [ Examples: ] 
    _________________________________________________
    | Grade | Frequency | Percentage %| Cumulative %|
    |-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
    | A     | 10        |    28       |    28       |
    | B     | 15        |    43       |    71       |
    | C     | 8         |    23       |    94       |

    | Total |   35      |   100%      |    100%     | 

# NOTE:========================================================================
# - Matrix table is the source to start the anaylsis
# - Frequency table is good to display the data where we can provide summary
#   for the dataset
# - You can use the ghraphs to summarize the data
# ==============================================================================

===[ Graphs: ]===
* Graphs are used to 'summarize a distibution' (dataset).

              [ Graphs: Catigorical Varibales ]

        |---------------------|---------------------|
    [ Pie chart ]                               [ Bar Graph ]
- It is 'circular chart'                 - It displays 'categorical data' 
  divided into 'slices'                    with rectangular bars
  where each slice                       - bar can be vertical or horizontal 
  represents a 'proprotion'              - The x-axis shows categories
  of the totoal                          - The y-axis shows values (frequency
- The whole circle reprsents               , percentage) 
  100% of the data                       - Bars are 'separated' to show they 
- each slice is sized according            represent distinct categories.
  the the 'relative frequency'           > [ Usage: ]
  (percentage)                             - Camparing 'discrete categories' 
> [ Usage: ]                                 (gender, type of fruite etc)
  - Showing 'percentage'                   - Highlighting difference in quantity
  - When the goal is to                      across groups.
    visualize 'how a whole is'
    'divided' into parts

# NOTE:=========================================================================
# - If the number of variables is large, the bar grpah is better than the
#   pie chart graph. 
# - Ghraphs are good for the case of categorical varibales (nominal level)
# ==============================================================================

> [ Dot Plot: Numerical/Quantitive Varibales ]
  * A dot plot is simple way to show 'frequency of data' using 'dots' each dot
    represents 'one occurrence' of a value in dataset. 
  - It is best for 'small moderate sets of numerical data' especially discret
    data. 

  > [ Example: ]
    - Let‚Äôs say you ask 10 students how many books they read last month.
      The data is:
      2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4

      Number of Books Read
      2: ‚óè‚óè‚óè
      3: ‚óè‚óè‚óè
      4: ‚óè‚óè
      5: ‚óè‚óè

        Or

      2   3   4   5
      ‚óè‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè ‚óè‚óè

  # CONCLUSION:=================================================================
  # - A dot plot is a quick and clear way to show how often each value occurs.
  # - It‚Äôs great for small data sets and helps spot patterns easily.
  # - Each dot = one observation.
  # ============================================================================

  > [ Histogram ]
    * A histogram is a type of graph that shows the 'distribution of a dataset',
      It looks similar to a 'bar graph' but it is used for 'continuous'
      numerical data rather than categories.

# TIP:==========================================================================
# - You should always convert quentitive variables to categorical variable by
#   using intervales. 
# - Examples: weight
#  
#  person 1: 80.9 
#  person 2: 70
#  person 3: 40.5
#  person 5: 90.1 
#  ...
#
# - To best way to visualize the data is to convert the continuous varibale to 
#   intervals 0 -> 20 | 20 -> 40 | 40 -> 60 | 60 -> 80 | 80 -> 100  
# ==============================================================================

  > [ Usage: ]
    - To show the shape of data: symmetrical, skewed, bimodal, etc.
    - To identify patterns, such as:
      * Central tendency (where values cluster)
      * Spread (how wide the data is)
      * Outliers or gaps

# CONCLUSION:[ GLOBAL ]=========================================================
# - Ghraphs is used to visualize, sammarize and get clear observation from
#   the data.
# - [Nominal/Ordinal] => Pie chart or Bar Ghraph  
# - [Interval/Ratio]  => Dot Plot or Histogram  
#===============================================================================

===[ Distribution Center: ]===
* In 'descriptive statistics' the 'center of a distribution' refers to the idea 
  of the 'middle' of your data set - where most values are located.
  - There are three main measures of the center: 

  |---------------------[ Measures of central tendency ]---------------------|
[ Mode ]                              |                                 [ Mean ]
- Most Frequent Value             [ Median ]                  - Add all values 
- The value that appears      - Middle Value                    and divide by  
  'most often'                - Arrange data in order and       the number of  
- Useful for 'categorical'      pick the middle one             values.
  and 'discrete' data.        - First sort/order the data     > Ex: 1 3 5 7 8 9
> Examples:                   - pick the middle number is       mean = 33 / 5 
  - Pie chart: mode is          'odd'                                = 6.6 
    the category of the       > Ex: 1 3 5 7 8|=> median:5 
    big slice.                - take the average of the
  - Histogram: in this          'two middle' numbers if 
    case we can have            the data numbers is 'even'
    the category of the       > Ex: 1 3 5 7 8 9 
    'two mode'.                 |=> median: 5 + 7 / 2 = 6 

# NOTE: Center is called 'middle point' or 'balance point'
# QUESTION:[ When should you report wich measure of central tendacy ?]==========
# - Measurment level variable defines which Measures of central tendency is used 
#   => Categorical          => Mode 
#   => Quentitive/Nemurical => If distribution has an outlier use median
#                              otherwise use 'mean'.
# ==============================================================================

===[ Measures of dispersion ]===================================================
* In addition to distribution 'central tendency' information there is another
  quentitiy that describes 'dispersion' (variability of data).
  - Measures of dispersion tell us how 'spread out' the values in a dataset are 
  - They show how much the 'data varies around the center' (like the mean
    or median).

# INFO: 
# - disperse: (verb) to spread across or move away over a large area.
#   . When the rain came down the crowds started to disperse.
# - dispersion: (noun)  ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™Ÿäÿ™

# QUESTION:[ Why datasets might have the same average but very different spreads]
# - Dispersion helps us understand: 
#   . 'Consistency' of the data
#   . 'Reliability' of the average 
#   . 'Outliers' and extreme values

  > [ Range: ]
    * Difference between the 'highest' and 'lowest' values. 
    > Formula: <Max - Min>
      - Usage: Simple but sensitive to outliers
  
# INFO:
# - Outlier value: extreme value 
# - In statistics Outlier is a data point that is 'significantly different'
#   from the rest of the values in a dataset.
# - It 'stands out' because it is either 'much higher' or 'much lower' than most 
#   of the data.
# > Example:
#   -> Imagine test scores from a class: 
#       65, 68 72 70 69 71 99
#   -> Most score are around  65 to 72 but 99 is mcuh higher, that's is likey
#      an 'outlier'.
# QUESTION:[ Why are Outliers Important ? ]
# - They can distort averages (especially mean) 
# - They might indicate 'data entry errors' unusual events, or
#   'interesting patterns' 
# - In some cases they should be 'removed' but sometimes they are
#   'very important' 

  > [ Interquartile Range (IQR) ]
    * The range of the 'middle 50%' of the data.
    - split the range into 4 quatiles

        25%   25%   25%   25%
      |-----|-----|-----|-----| 
            Q1    Q2    Q3
               (Median)

     > Formula: [ IQR = Q3 - Q1 ]

    - Less affected by outliers, good for skewed data.

# NOTE:
# - Ouliers is the value lower than Q1 - 1.5*(IQR) or higher than Q3 + 1.5*(IQR)

  > [ Box Plot ]
  * 'Box plot' is a powerful way to visualize 'distribution', 'spread', and
    'outliers' in dataset
  - A 'box plot' is a graphical summary of data that shows:
    . 'The center' (median)
    . 'The spread' (range and interquartile range) 
    . 'the shape' (symmetry or skewness)
    . 'Outliers' 

  - It uses a box and two whiskers to display this information.

  |__________________________________________________

  > [ Variance: ]
    * The 'average squared deviation' from the mean. 
    - while 'range' use the 'min and max' and 'interquartile range' excludes the
      'outliers values', The 'variance' uses 'all the values'. 

    > [ Formula: ]

        s^2 = 1 / n - 1 * sum(i=1 -> n) (Xi - X-bar)^2

        - X-bar: is the represent the mean 
        - Xi - X-bar: residual or error between mean f(x) = X-bar = Constant 
          and each variable Xi 
        - n: number of values
        - variance represents a 'relative percentage' of distribution around the mean.

    # INFO: Gives a mathematical measure of spread, but in 'squared units'.
    # [ Larger variance ] => [ Larger variability ]: and vice versa 

# NOTE:
# - The problem with variation is the unit, what is the unit of
#   s^2

  > [ Standard Deviation: ]
    * The square root of variance, it 'show how much values deviate from the'
      'mean' in the same units as the data (It is the average of errors or
      residuals)

    > [ Formula: ]
      
      [ s = s^2 = sqrt(1 / n - 1 * sum(i=1 -> n) (Xi - X-bar)^2) ] 
    - Very common, especially in normal distributions.
    
    # CONCLUSION:
    # Standard Deviation is the average distance of each data point from the mean 

  > [ MAD: Mean Absolute Deviation ]
    * Measures the 'average absolute' Deviation 
    > [ Formula ]
      MAD = 1 / n * sum(i=1->n) |xi - x-bar|

    - Easier to interpret than variance; not affected by squaring.

===[ Z-scores ]=================================================================
* Z-score tells you 'how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean'.

 - The main goal from the z-score is 'STANDARDIZATION' means => replace the
   original scores by standard deviations from the mean (changing the original
   value by another quentity that describe how the standart deviation faraway
   from the mean)
 - If we take an observation how far from the mean based on the
   standard deviation (percentage of standard deviation, ex: 0.50
   |=> means it is farway by 50% from the standart deviation)

# REVISION:
# standard deviation => sqrt(errors^2 / n - 1) 

  > [ Formula: ]
    [ z-score = x - mean / standart deviation ] 

  - A Z-score of 0 ‚Üí the value is exactly the mean.
  - A positive Z-score ‚Üí the value is above the mean.
  - A negative Z-score ‚Üí the value is below the mean.
  _________________________________________________
  | Z-score Range      | Interpretation           |
  |--------------------|--------------------------|
  | -1 to +1           | Typical/average values   |
  | -2 to -1 or 1 to 2 | Unusual, but not extreme |
  | < -2 or > +2       | Likely outliers          |

# INFO:[ Standardization ]
# - Standardization is a 'numerical transformation' used to 'rescale data'
#   so that is has:
# - A mean of 0
# - A standard deviation of 1
# > [ Purpose: ]
#   - Normalize features before traning machine learning models 

===[ Application: ]==============================================================
* We have 8 schools where xi i E [1, 8] represents the average in math on the
  scale 0|-->10

 # NOTE: Matrix table is the source of my dataset 

- We need to summarize and visualize the dataset using one of the graphs 
  The variable math average is a quentitive varibale with interval levels but
  it is too small so the best graph in this exmaple is 'the dot plot'

  # NOTE:
  # - from the dot plot we can tell that 4.1 is an outlier value
  
  - Let's explore more data or information about our dataset by
    find the 'central tendency'.


    |------------------[ Central Tendency ]------------------|
    |                           |                            |
 [ Mode ]                   [ Median ]                    [ Mean ]
 - Most frequent          m = 7.1 + 7.4 / 2         x-bar = sum (1->8) / 8 
   value = 7.4            m = 7.25                        = 6.86
                        - sort values and
                          take the middle
                          one if odd otherwise
                          the average between the 
                          two middle values

- We get the central tandency, It is the time to measure dispersion/variance
  of the distribution.

  |-------------------[ Measure of dispersion ]-------------------|
  |                               |                               |
[ Range ]              [ InterQuartile Range ]            [ Standard Deviation ]
=> max - min              => IQR = Q3 - Q1                => sqrt (error ^ 2 / n - 1) 
=> 8.1 - 4.1              => Q1 = 6.2 + 6.y / 2           => 1.27 
=> 4                      => Q1 = 6.45  
                          => Q3 = 7.4 + 7.9 / 2 
                          => 7.65 
                          -> IQR = 7.65 - 6.45 
                                 = 1.2

- Now let's construct a box plot
- We have:
  Q1 = 6.45 
  Q2 = (median) 7.25
  Q3 = 7.65 
  IQR = 1.2 

9 _|

4 _|              *
   |
3 _|_____________________________________

> [ Rule: ]
  - If there is a value < Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, This value is an 'outlier' value 
  - if there is a value > Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, This value is an 'outlier' value 

  | Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 6.45 - 1.8 = 4.65 
=>|
  | Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 7.4 + 1.8 = 9.45 

- We notice that we have a value 4.1 < 4.65 so this value is outlier and it is
  represented by a dot '*'
  - The end of the 'whisker' would be the value > 4.1 in our dataset => 6.2 
- There is no value > 9.45 so there is no outlier value over here.
  'Whisker' will take the max value '8.1'

- We have a clean observation about the distribution data. but we are going to
  calculate z-score of school 3

  => z-score = 4.1 - 6.86 (mean) / 1.27 standard deviation  
  => z-score = -2.17  | this value is under mean by 2.17 from the standard
                        deviation 
  => -2.17 tells that the value 4.1 is an outlier value. 

===[ Correlation between two variables: ]=======================================
* Correlation is a 'statistical concept' measure 'how much one variable changes'
  'when another variable changes'.

===[ Crosstab: Contingency table ]==============================================
* A cross tabulation (or crosstab) is a 'matrix-style table' that displays the 
  'frequency distribution' of varibales -- useually used for 'catigorical'
  'varibales'

  > [ Contingency Table structure: ]
    - Rows: represent the 'categories' of one varibale 
    - Columns: represent the 'categoriess' of another variable. 
    - Each 'cell' shows the 'count (or frequencty)' of 'occurrences' for a
      particular 'combination of the two variables' 

- Let's say you surveyed 100 people about their 'preferred drink' and their
  'gender'

  > [ Example: ]
             ________________________
             | Coffee | Tea | Juice | Total 
    |--------|--------|-----|-------|------
    | Male   | 20     | 10  | 5     | 35    
    | Female | 25     | 30  | 10    | 65    
    |--------|--------|-----|-------|------
      Total  | 45     | 40  | 15    | 100

    - This table shows the count of drink preferences broken down by gender.
    - Each cell tells how many people fall into that combination (ex: 20 male
      prefer coffe)
    - The 'marginal totals' (last row/column) show the totals for each category

# PROBLEM: We still can't get the relationship between variables 
  > Let's change how many people fall into combination by their percentage.
    This quentity is called 'column precentage'
             ___________________________
             | Coffee | Tea    | Juice | 
    |--------|--------|--------|-------|
    | Male   | 44.44  | 25     | 33.33 | 
    | Female | 55.55  | 75     | 66.66 | 
    |--------|--------|--------|-------|
      Total  | 100%   | 100%   | 100%  |

    - Example: 20 / 45 * 100 

- We can convert 25% (percentage) to 0.25 ('Proportions') 
             ___________________________
             | Coffee | Tea    | Juice | Marginal Propotions
    |--------|--------|--------|-------|------------
    | Male   | 0.4444 | 0.25   | 0.33  | 0.35 
    | Female | 0.5555 | 0.75   | 0.66  | 0.65 
    |--------|--------|--------|-------|------------
      Total  | 1.0    | 1.0    | 1.0   | 1.0

# EXPLANATION:
  - 66 % of people that drink juice are female 
  - 25 % of people that drink tea are male
    ...
  - In this example we can see that drink preference
    is independent of gender in this sample.

# NOTE:=========================================================================
# - These Proportions are called 'conditional proportions' 
#   . 0.25 propotion is related to two variables (male, tea), That is why is
#     called canditional.
# - In the other hand we have propotions that are related to one varibale
#   called 'marginal propotions'
#   . 0.35 is the propotion of males in my sample, (related to male case only) 
# CONCLUSION:===================================================================
# Crosstab (contingency table) is used for => categorical variables 
# ==============================================================================

===[ Scatter plot: ]============================================================
* A scatter plot shows relationship between 'two' continuous (numerical)
  variables.

  # INFO:
  # scatter: (verb) to (to cause) move far apart in different directions  
  # . The soldiers came in and scattered the crowd.

  |-------------------> x (independent varibale)

  - From the scatter plot we can know the type of correlation and direction
    but it is hard to know the 'strangth' of the correlation. We need to find a
    quentity that 'measure' the strangth, This quentity is called "Pearson'r" 

# CONCLUSION:===================================================================
# - Contingency table or scatter plot are used to describe the relationship
#   between two variables.
# - Contingency table => categorical varibales 
# - Scatter plot      => Numerical variables
# ==============================================================================

===[ Pearson Correaltion coefficient: Pearson'R ]===
* Pearson Correlation coefficient(r) is 'statistical measure' of the
  'strength and direction' of the 'linear relationship' between 
  'two continous (numerical) variables'

  # INFO:=======================================================================
  # - Pearson refers to Karl Pearson (1857-1936) a british mathematician and one
  #   of the 'founders of modern statistics'.
  # ============================================================================

  > [ Formula: ]
    
    [ r = sum(Zx * Zy) / n - 1 ]

    * Zx: is the Z-score of each x
    * Zy: is the Z-score of each y
    * n : number of cases  
    * [ -1 <= r <= 1  ] 
      . r = 0: no linear correaltion 
      . r > 0: positive linear correlation 
      . r < 0: negative lineaer correlation 
      . r == 1: perfect positive linear correlation 
      . r == -1: perfect negative linear correlation 

  # NOTE:[ Important ]==========================================================
  # - 'r' stands for 'relation' or 'regression'  
  # - Pearson'r does not tell us the type of correlation instead use scatter
  #   plot to check the correlation's type before calculating Pearson'r.
  # ============================================================================

===[ Regression : ]===
* Regression is a statistical method used to 'model and analyze the'
  'relationship between' a dependent varibale (output)' and one or more
  'independent variables'.

- It answers questions like:
    " How does Y change when X changes ?"

        |--------------------[ Type of Regression ]--------------------|
        |                   |                      |                   | 
  [ Linear ]        [ Multiple-linear]       [ Polynomial ]       [ Logistic ]
- Models a          - It use 'more than'    - Fits a 'curved'   - Used when the
  'stright-line'      one input varibale      line instead of     'output' is  
  relationship      - Formula:                a stright line      'categorical'
  between             Y = A1*X1 + A2*X2\    - Formula:            (e.g yes/no
  input and               + ... + AnXn        Y = a*X + b*X^2\     0/1 ...)
  output.                 + C                     + ... + C
- Formula:
  Y = ax + b

  # NOTE:=======================================================================
  # e.g: is a latin abbreviation means 'exempli gratia' which means for example 
  # ============================================================================

# QUESTION:[ Why Use Regression ?]============================================== 
# - Prediction: Estimate Future outcomes.
# - Explanation: Understand relationship between variables.
# - Inference: 'Quantify' the strength and direction of effects. 
# - Modeling: build mathematical models for decision-making.
# ==============================================================================

===[ Regression line: ]===
* It is the best stright-line that describe the linear relationship between two
  variables.

  > [ Regression analysis: ]
    * Regression analysis is a powerful 'statistical' method used to:
    "Understand the relationship between variables and make 'predictions' based"
    "on that relationship"

  - To make prediction we need to use the line equation:
    [ Y-hat = ax + b]

    - Where:
      * a = r * (Sy / Sx)         | S: standard deviation
                                  | # INFO: a unstandardized Pearson's R
      ----------------------------|--------------------------------------
      * b = y-bar - a * x-bar     | y-bar: mean of y
                                  | x-bar: mean of x

  > [ How good is the line: Fitting ]
    - The line makes the best fitting with the data when we get a good Accuracy
      of prediction. but how to measure the data fitting ? using 'r^2'
      (Pearson's R)^2

    - 'r^2' tells you how much better a regression line predicts the value of a
      dependent varibale than the mean of the variable.

    > [ Example: ]
      r^2 = 0.65 |=> 'prediction error' is 65% smaller than when use the 'mean' 
                 |=> The amount of variance in your dependent varibale (Y) that 
                     is explained by your independent variable (X).


# QUESTION:[ What is 'Analysis' ?]==============================================
# - In general Analysis means:
# " The process of examining something carefully and systematically by breaking"
# "it down into its parts to better understand it, interpret it,"
# "or solve a problem"
# - It comes from the Greek word 'analusis' meaning "a breaking up" or
#   "loosening".
# >>> Analysis in Different Fields <<< 
# - Math: analysis is a branch focused on 'limits', continuity, differentiation 
#   , integration, and infinite series -- essentially, the rigorous study of
#   change and motion.
# - Data Science: analysis refers to the process of 'exploring', 'cleaning',
#   'transforming', and 'modeling data' to extract useful insights and inform 
#   decision-making.
# QUESTION:[ Standardization VS Normalization ]=================================
# - standardization and normalization are different techniques used in data  
#   preprocessing especially in machine learning and statistics.
# > Simple Analogy:
# - Standardization is like adjusting everyone's test score so the average is 0 
#   and spread is even. z <= x <= y      | x, z, y E |R
# - Normalization is like rescaling all scores so the lowest is 0 and the
#   highest is 100. 0 <= x <= 1 (proportions)
#
# ==============================================================================

===[ Correlation Vs Causation: ]===

> [ Correlation: ]
  * A statistical relationship between two variables
    - Meaning: When one varibale 'changes', the other tends to 'change as well'
    
  # NOTE:
  # - Correlation IS NOT causation 
  # - Ex: maybe two varibales changes together but
  #       no causation between both values 

  |> Example: [ Chocklet and  body weight ]
    - It seems that the more you eat chocolate the more the weight increase.  
      |=> Chocklet consumtion: Independent varibale  | body weight: dependent variable. 

      Or

    - The more you are heavy, the more you can eat too much chocolate 
      |=> body weight: Independent varibale | chocolate consumption
          dependent varibale 

  # NOTE:
  # - The correlation seems in both direction, but no causation relation where   
  #   a variable cause  the other variable, this correlation is fake. 
  # - We can say that There is another varibale that cause body weight and
  #   chocolate consumption, is called 'Genetics'.
  # - Genetices that cause/effect body weight and chocolet consumption 
  
  |> Example: [ Ice cream sales & drowning incidents ] 
     - Ice cream sales & dorwning incidents both increase in summer. 
     - They are 'correlated' (both go up), but eating ice cream does not 'cause'
       drowning.
     - A 'Third factor (hot weather)' affects both.

> [ Causation: ]
  * One varibale 'directly causes' a change in another
    - Requires evidence (like an experiment or deep analysis) 
    - Causation means 'a change in X causes a change in Y' 

  |> Example
    - Smoking causes lunch cancer (There is a relationship: years of studies
      and biological mechanisms show this) 

# INFO:[ Analogy ]=============================================================
# - Correlation is like dancing together. Causation is like one person pushing the other.
# NOTE:
# - Regression analysis is effected by outliers, If it is found, You must
#   invistigvate the value, If it is wrong => you can remove it from data set
# - It is HARD TO PROVE CAUSATION between two variables.

===[ Application: ]=============================================================

===[ Contingency table: ]===
* We are going to take a sample from morocco that contains 3 categories based
  on their level of education, We will ask them if they do believe in aliens:
  - they have to answer, agree, disagree or nor agree nor disagree

  > [ Analysis: ]
    - Case      : Person
    - Variables : Education, Response  

    # NOTE:
    # - Level of measurment is Nominal (categorical varibales) 
  
  > [ Matrix table/data ] 

          ___________________________
          | Education  |  Response  |
  ________|____________|____________|
  Case 1  |     Low    |    Agree   |
  --------|------------|------------|
  Case 2  |    hight   |  disagree  |
  --------|------------|------------|
  case 3  |   Middle   |  Nor ...   |
  ...                               |
  -----------------------------------

  > [ Contingency Table: ]
    - We are going to use the contingeny table to understand the relationship 
    between two categorical varibales

             ____________________________
             |  Low  |  Middle  | High  | Total 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Agree    |  12   |  31      |   25  | 68 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Disagree |  26   |  38      |   17  | 81 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Nor      |  64   |  40      |   8   | 112
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Total    |  102  |  109     |  50   | 261

    - As we can see the contingency table does not describe the relationship
      between 'education' and 'beleive'.
    - Let is use the 'conditional proportions' and 'marginal proportions' 
             ____________________________
             |  Low  |  Middle  | High  | Total 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Agree    |  0.12 |  0.30    |  0.5  | 0.26 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Nor      |  0.26 |  0.34    |  0.34 | 0.31 
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Disagree |  0.62 |  0.36    |  0.16 | 0.43
    ---------|-------|----------|-------|-------
    Total    |  1.0  |  1.0     |  1.0  | 1.0

  - 12% of 'low education' people said 'agree'.
  - 5% of 'high education' people said 'agree' 
  - 62% of 'low education' people said 'disagree'
  # CONCLUSION:
  # - People with high education is the most people that believe in being 
  #   exitence outside the earth
