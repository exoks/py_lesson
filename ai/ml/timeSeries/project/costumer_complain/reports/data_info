===[ General Information About Port Logistics ]=================================

Truck --> Autorisation --> Couloir --> entree_scanner --> scanner export -->
entree_visite -> Embarkement

===[ TIR Vs Without TIR ]===
- TIR stands for 'Transports Internationaux Routiers' (International Road
  Transport), It is a 'international customs transit system' that allows "goods"
  "to travel across multiple countries with minimal customs checks in beetween"
  , as long as they stay sealed and under 'TIR' rules.

  # NOTE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # physically, a 'TIR container can be the same as a normal ISO SHIPPING'
  # 'CONTAINER', The difference is:
  #	- It must be build to 'TIR Convention specifications' (no hidden
  #	  compartments, secure sealing points, lockable doors).
  #	- It is officially 'approved' by customs authorities for TIR use.

  > [ Example: ]
    - If you ship goods from Morocco to Germany by truck:
      . 'With TIR': Customs seals the container in Morroco, the truck cross spain
                    and france without full customs stops, and is opend only in germany.
      . 'Without TIR': the truck is stopped and checked at each border, with
                       paperwork and possible inspections.

===[ AMP service ]===
* AMP (Autorisation de Mouvement Portuair / Port Movement Authorization) is a  
  mandatory electronic authorization document for freight units - whether
  for 'import' or 'export' and it is fully 'digitized' as part of Tanger Med 
  (Med's smart logistics infrastructure).

  # QUESTION:[ What is the meaning of 'AMPE' service ?]-------------------------
  # Try to deeply understand this part when you get the full dataset.

===[ FLOW: ]====================================================================

1|>[ Administrative formalities ]=====================================
===[ 'DATE_CREATION', 'DATE_OPERATION', 'DATE_VALIDATION' ]===
  . 'DATE_CREATION': When the digital autorization request is requested 

  . 'DATE_OPERATION': When the operation starts 
   # NOTE:-----------------------------------------------
   # - 'DATE_CREATION' and 'DATE_OPERATION' are the same.
   # - So i can simply remove the 'DATE_OPERATION' column

  . 'DATE_VALIDATION': when the document autorization is validated request is
   validated.

===[ 'DATE_IMPRESSION' ]===
* print date, it's when the documents are printed

===[ 'NO_AMP' ]===
* number of degital autorization document under the AMP system.

===[ 'AMPE' ]===
* Maybe It is another stage in the AMP system.


2|>[ ZRE Area : ]===================================================== 
===[ 'DATE_ZRE' ]===
===[ 'NO_ZRE' ]===


3|>[ 'Corridor (COULOIR)' ]===========================================
===[ 'COULOIR' ]===

===[ 'ENTREE_COULOIR' ]===
* when enter 'COULOIR'


4|>[ 'Parking AREA' ]===========================================================
===[ 'ENTREE_PARK_VISITE' ]===
* date when the unit/truck entred the "port's parking visitation area" before 
  processing.

===[ 'TERMINAL' ]===
===[ 'ENTREE_TERMINAL_EXPORT' ]===
* This is the 'timestamp when the cargo (container, TIR, or goods)' physically 
  enters the 'export terminal area' within the port.

===[ 'SORTIE_TERMINAL_IMPORT' ]===

===[ 'ENTREE_SCANNER_EXPORT' ]===
* It is the time when the 'cargo (container, TIR unit, or goods)' enters the 
  'export scanning area' at the port

===[ 'DEBUT_VISITE_PHYSIQUE_EXPORT' ]===
* the Start of 'physical scanning' after initial steps like scanning (someone
  physically checks the cargo).

===[ 'FIN_VISITE_PHYSIQUE_EXPORT' ]===
* The end of 'physical scanning' 

===[ 'ENTREE_SAS_IMPORT' ]===
===[ 'SORTIE_SAS_IMPORT' ]===
===[ 'SORTIE_SAS_EXPORT' ]===
* In your dataset almost certainly refers to the 'timestamp when goods exit' 
  "the export 'SAS' zone". 
  - SAS stands for Secure controlled-access zone (like a customs gate or export
    gate) that goods pass throw before boarding a vessel.

  - SORTIE_SAS_EXPORT = the moment cargo leaves that secure export zone ‚Äî
    typically right before it‚Äôs loaded.

5|>[ 'EMBARQUEMENT' Area (loading into vessel) ]===================
===[ 'EMBARQUEMENT' ]===
* Most likely refers to the 'place or port of loading', the location where goods
  are 'put on board' a ship, (truck or other transport for departure).
  - It can be 'a code or name' for the port/terminal where goods are loaded

    > example: EMB250080127

===[ 'DATE_EMBARQUEMENT' ]===
* It is when the goods enters 'EMBARQUEMENT' area.
  # NOTE:----------------------------------------------------
  # - 'DATE EMBARQUEMENT' & 'EMBARQUEMENT EXPORT' are similar 

===[ 'EMBARQUEMENT_EXPORT' ]===
* when goods re actually loaded onto the export vessel (ship, truck, or other
  transport) 
  # NOTE:> this is useually the final export process at the prot before the
  # goods leaves the port. 

===[ 'STATUT_EXPLOITATION' ]===
* means 'operational status'.

  > Meanings:
    - cl√¥ture ‚Äî Closed
      The operation or process is finished and formally closed.

    - lib√©r√© ‚Äî Released
      The cargo or shipment has been cleared and is free to move or exit.

    - contr√¥le exploitation ex√©cut√© ‚Äî Operational control executed
      The inspection or control step has been completed successfully.

    - annul√© ‚Äî Canceled
      The operation or shipment has been canceled or aborted.



================================================================================
- The rest of informations are recoreded throw this process, so there is no
  point to know which step is recorded.


===[ 'TYPE_UNITE' ]===
* It tell us the 'mode/from' of transport
  . 'TIR'
  . 'Conteneur' (without TIR)

===[ 'SS_UNITE_TYPE': ]===
* This gives 'more specification' with each `TYPE_UNITE`.
  - IF `UNITE_TYPE` = `TIR`
    . 'Ensemble routier' => Road train (truck + tailer combination)
    . 'Semi Remorque'	 => Semi-Trailer (pulled by a truck tractor)

  - If `UNITE_TYPE` = 'Conteneur'
    . 40' => 40-foot ISO container (You may also consider 20' or other sizes
      in different datasets).

===[ 'VIDE_PLEIN' ]=== 
* Either the container is 'Full / PLEIN' or 'Empty / VIDE'

===[ 'NATURE_MARCHANDISE' ]===
* type of goods

===[ 'MATIER_DANGER' ]===
* True/False: Indicating the presense of dangerous materials.


THIS PART GIVES more information about vissel that would ship the goods.
===[ 'ESCALE' ]===
- 'ESCALE': is the 'port call'. each port call gets a 'unique escale number'

  > Example: ESC250080524
    . ESC: prefix meaning 'Escale'
    . 2500: A sequence or code identifying the vessel or the visit order in
      the year.
    . 0524: could be the date or something else.

  # QUESTION:[ Why some goods have 'ESCALE' some 'NOT'? ]------------------------
  # - Goods with 'ESCALE': These are linked to a vessel
  #   . TIR: if the truck is only passing through the port and going to spain 
  #          it may not have an 'ESCALE' because it is not linked to a vissel
  # - Goods without 'ESCALE': These are not linked to a vessel  
  #   . Conteneur: most likely to have an 'ESCALE' if it's being loaded/unloaded 
  #                from a container ship.

  # NOTE:------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - TIR units with type (semi-remorque) has => 'ESCALE'
  # - TIR units with type (ensemble routier)  => NO 'ESCALE'
  # - Conteneur 40' / 20'                     => NO 'ESCALE'
  # - Camion 12m ou moins		      => NO 'ESCALE' 

===[ 'NOM_NAVIRE' ]===
* vissel name

===[ 'IMO_NAVIRE' ]===
* IMO stands for 'International Maritime Organization'. 
- the IMO number is a 'unique premanent 7-digit number' assigned to every seagoing
  vessel by the IMO, It is like a ship license plate, It never changes, even if 
  the ship changes:
  . Name
  . Flag country
  . Owner or operator

- It is like a 'vessel id', it does tell you exactly the vissel
# NOTE:--------------------------------------------------------------
# You can replace all `ESCALE`, `NOM_NAVIRE` and 'ESCALE' by 'ESCALE'
# '(TRUE/FALSE)'. 

===[ 'ETA', 'ETD', 'RTA', 'RTD' ]===
- 'ETA': Estimated time of arrival 
- 'ETD': Estimated time of departure 
- 'RTA': Real-time of arrival 
- 'RTD': Real-time of departure 

===[ 'ETAT_DECHARGEMENT' ]===
* This feature shows the 'current status of the unloading process' of the cargo 
  or freight unit from the ship, container, truck, or other transport means.
  # NOTE:> removed

===[ 'POIDS' ]===

===[ 'STATUT_ADM' ]===
* ???

===[ 'GROUPAGE' ]===
* is where goods from different shippers are grouped together into the same
  container or transport unit to optimize space and cost.

  [ It is given as id reference number | ex > 4110012050017845 ]
  # NOTE:---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # - If the shipment is 'full load', maybe this field is blank or uses another
  #   code

===[ 'TYPE_TRACTION' ]===
* is the 'type of traction (vehicle)' used to move the cargo unit.

===[ 'MAFI' ]===
* 'MAFI trailer' is a flatbed platform designed to carry containers, heavy
  machinery, or vehicles
  - It is often used to transport 'non-containerized cargo' that can be rolled
    on and off ships.
  => It is given by the specific MAFI unit IDs 

===[ 'DATE_COMMAND_TR' ]===
* It is the 'date and time when a transport/truck order or command was issued'
  for moving cargo

===[ 'MAQ_EXPORT' ]===
??

===[ 'DATE_SEND' ]===
?? date send from wich point


===[ WHY 'NO_TRACTEUR' is missing ? ]===
* If the NO_TRACTEUR is missing, it may mean:
  - The unit was stationary or in storage (no tractor assigned at that moment).
  - The record was captured at a stage where the tractor wasn‚Äôt yet attached
    (e.g., before loading for road transport).
