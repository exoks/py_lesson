===[ Math: Derivative ]=========================================================
* At its core, a 'derivative' measures 'how something changes'. More precisely,
  it tells you the 'rate of change' of a fucntion at any given point.

Taking a derivative means you are answring this question:
  "if I change the input a little, how much does the output change ?"

> Mathematically:  
  - Given a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells you how fast f changes
    'with respect to' x.

> [ Examples: ]
  1|> Let is say a position of a car over time is given by:
      [ f(t) = t^2 ]
  
  - This means the cars distance from home at seconds is t^2 meters
    the derivative is:
      [ f'(t) = 2t ]

  - at t = 4 seconds
      f(4) = 16 (car distance is 16m )
      f'(4) =  8
  
    t    | 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  | s 
    -----|------------------------|----
    f(t) | 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 | m 
    -----|------------------------|----
    f'(t)| 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8  | m/s 

  - This means at t=3 the car distance is 9m and it is moving 6 ms at this point 
  # CONCLUSION:=================================================================
  # - So, The derivative tells us the velocity — how fast the position is      |
  #   changing.                                                                |
  # ============================================================================

  - let is make the the rate of changes constant: grows constant. 
    [ f(t) = t ]
    
    - the derivation is:
      [ f'(t) = 1 ] 
  
  - This means that the speed is changing by [ 1 m/s ] at any point.

  2|> [ Cost Function: ]
      - Let’s say a company’s production cost is:
          C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.5x^2
          C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.5x^2

      - Where xx is the number of products made, and CC is the cost in dollars.
        The derivative:
          C′(x) = 5 + x

      - This means:
        * For each additional unit made, cost increases by 5 + x dollars
        * At x=10: cost increases by 15 dollars per unit
        * It tells how marginal cost behaves

  3|> [ Population Growth: ]
      - Suppose a population grows according to:
        P(t) = 1000 * e^0.03t

      - Where tt is in years. The derivative is:
        P'(t) = 1000 * 0.03 * e^0.03t

      - It tells how fast the population is growing at any time 't', and that
        growth is 'exponential'.

    _____________________________________________________________________
    | Function f(x)   | Derivative f'(x)   | Interpretation             |
    |-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
    | x^2             | 2x                 | Change grows linearly      |
    | x^3             | 3x^2               | Change grows quadratically |
    | sin(x)          | cos(x)             | Change oscillates          |
    | e^x             | e^x                | Growth matches size        |
    | ln(x)           | 1/x                | Slows as x grows           |
    |_________________|____________________|____________________________|

===[ Math: Partial Derivative ]================================================= 
* A partial derivative measures 'how a multivariable function changes with the'
  'respect to one variable while holding all the variables constant'.

  > Ex:
      f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2

  - How does 'f' change if i change 'x' a little, but keep 'y' fixed ?
    |=> that is 'the partial derivative with the respect to x' written ∂f/∂x
  - How does 'f' change if i change 'y' a littel, but keep 'x' fixed ? 
    |=> that is 'the partial derivative with the respect to y' written ∂f/∂y

# QUESTION:[ Why are partial derivative used ?]
- Because many real-world systems depend on multiple variables, partial
  derivatives help us isolate the effect of just one variable.

  |____________________|_______________________________________________________|

> [ Examples: Derivative VS Partial Derivative ]
  [[[ Derivative]]]
    f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
  - This has 'one variable' x, so we use the regular derivaitve:
    f'(x) = d/dx(3x^2 + 2x + 1) = 6x + 2
  - [ This tell us the slop (rate fo change) of the function at any point x ] 

 [[[ Partial Derivative ]]] 
    f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2

    | ∂f/∂x = 6x + 2y 
  --|
    | ∂f/∂y = 2x + 2y

  - These tell us:
    * How 'f' changes in the 'x direction' (slop if you walk east).
    * How 'f' changes in the 'y direction' (slop if you walk north).

  # INFO:
  # - Steep (of a slop) rising of falling at a sharp angle.
  #   ex: a steep slop
  # - Descent (Noun) a Movement down 

===[ Analogy: ]=================================================================
- Imagine you're on a hill.
- The derivative is like walking along a 1D trail — you're asking
  |=> "how steep is the path right here?"

  The partial derivative is like looking at the steepness:

  - North-South (∂f/∂y)
  - East-West (∂f/∂x)

- You're still on the hill, but you're isolating one direction at a time.

===[ In Software Term: 💻 ]======================================================
* Derivative:
  - Used when modeling simple curves or optimizing single-variable functions.

* Partial Derivative:
  - Crucial in:
    > Gradient Descent (you compute partials for each variable)
    > Neural Networks (backpropagation uses partial derivatives)
    > Physics Engines (e.g., surface normals)
    > Multivariable optimization (e.g., tuning hyperparameters)

# CONCLUSION:
# - Derivatives are for single-variable functions.
# - Partial derivatives are for multi-variable functions.
# - Partial derivatives are just an extension of the derivative idea
#   => they measure change in one direction while holding others constant.
